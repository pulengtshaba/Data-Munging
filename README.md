# Task 4: insert data from multiple csv files into an SQLite database

### Part 1: Get the data

First, you need to get your hands on the relevant data. The shipping department has been kind enough to provide you with a repository containing all of their spreadsheets, as well as a copy of the sqlite database. First, fork and clone the repository at: https://github.com/theforage/forage-walmart-task-4

### Part 2: Populate the database

Your task is to insert all of the data contained in the provided spreadsheets into the SQLite database. You will write a Python script which:

* Reads each row from the spreadsheets.
* Extracts the relevant data.
* Munges it into a format that fits the database schema.
* Inserts the data into the database.
